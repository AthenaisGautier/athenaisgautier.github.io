Welcome!

Since November 2018, I am doing my PhD at the IMSV, Departement of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Bern , working on the "Uncertainty quantification and efficient design of experiments for data- and simulation-driven inverse problem solving" project under Pr. David Ginsbourger supervision.


My research interests include, but are not restricted to Gaussian processes and uncertainty quantification, density estimation, non-parametric Bayesian approaches, stochastic optimisation and stochastic inverse problems.

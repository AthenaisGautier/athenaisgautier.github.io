Welcome!

I am currently working as a Research Engineer at ONERA, the French Aerospace Lab, where I focus on uncertainty quantification and multidisciplinary optimization for aerospace vehicle design.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [COSMO Laboratory](https://cosmo.mcgill.ca/), at McGill university, Montréal (Canada), where I work in Prof. Roussos Dimitrakopoulos' research group. My work there centered on stochastic modeling and uncertainty quantification for spatial data.

Prior to that, I defended my thesis on May 19th 2023. During my doctoral studies, which commenced in November 2018, I had the privilege of being a part of the IMSV, University of Bern (Switzerland). Under the supervision of Professor David Ginsbourger, my research focused on "Uncertainty quantification and efficient design of experiments for data- and simulation-driven inverse problem solving".  

My research interests span across several areas, including Gaussian processes and uncertainty quantification, non-parametric Bayesian approaches, stochastic optimization, and stochastic inverse problems. I also have a strong interest in kernel methods that extend beyond Gaussianity assumptions.

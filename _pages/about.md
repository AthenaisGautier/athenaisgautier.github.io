Welcome!

I am excited to share that I recently completed my Ph.D. journey, defending my thesis on May 19th 2023. During my doctoral studies, which commenced in November 2018, I had the privilege of being a part of the IMSV, University of Bern (Switzerland). Under the supervision of Professor David Ginsbourger, my research focused on "Uncertainty quantification and efficient design of experiments for data- and simulation-driven inverse problem solving". 
I am thrilled to soon join the [COSMO Laboratory](https://cosmo.mcgill.ca/), at McGill university, Montréal (Canada), where am honoured to join Prof. Roussos Dimitrakopoulos' research group to work on geostatistics and stochastic simulations.

Currently, I am thrilled to be in the organisation committee of [Lifting Inference with Kernel Embeddings (LIKE23)](https://like23-bern.github.io/), check it out! 

My research interests span across several areas, including Gaussian processes and uncertainty quantification, non-parametric Bayesian approaches, stochastic optimization, and stochastic inverse problems. I also have a strong interest in kernel methods that extend beyond Gaussianity assumptions.
